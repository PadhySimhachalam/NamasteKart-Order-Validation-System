NamasteKart-Order-Validation-System
-------------------------------------------

An automated data validation and file processing project built to ensure daily retail orders are accurate, clean, and business-ready.
This project focuses on validating transactions for NamasteKart (operating in Bangalore and Mumbai) using Python ETL logic with robust error handling and file segregation.

Tech Stack
-----------------

Python (csv, os, datetime, shutil) â€“ File processing, validations, and automation

Pandas (optional extension) â€“ Advanced data validation & transformations

CSV â€“ Input order data & master product data

File System â€“ Organized folder hierarchy for incoming, success, and rejected files

Data Source
------------------
Product Master (product_master.csv)
Product ID
Price
Daily Orders (orders_YYYYMMDD.csv)
Order ID
Order Date
Product ID
Quantity
Sales Amount
City

Goal of the Project
----------------------------
Validate daily orders against strict business rules.
Move clean files to success_files and problematic files to rejected_files.
Generate error files listing rejected orders with detailed rejection reasons.
Ensure business users are quickly notified of data quality issues.

Validations Implemented
------------------------------------

Product Validation â€“ Product ID must exist in product master.

Sales Validation â€“ Sales amount must equal price Ã— quantity.

Date Validation â€“ Order date cannot be in the future.

Empty Field Validation â€“ No missing values in order record.

City Validation â€“ Orders must belong to Mumbai or Bangalore only.

ðŸ”„ Walkthrough of File Processing

Incoming Files â†’ Stored in incoming_files/YYYYMMDD/.

Validation Checks â†’ Each order record is validated.

Successful Files â†’ If all orders in a file are valid, move file to success_files/YYYYMMDD/.

Rejected Files â†’ If even one order fails, move full file to rejected_files/YYYYMMDD/.

Generate an additional file error_{filename}.csv with only rejected rows + rejection reasons.

ðŸ“Š Example Outcomes

10 Incoming Files

8 Successful Files â†’ All orders passed validations

2 Rejected Files â†’ With corresponding error logs

Sample Error Log
----------------------
order_id	order_date	product_id	quantity	sales	city	rejected_reason
1005	2025-09-05	P999	2	500	Pune	Invalid Product ID; Invalid City
1009	2025-09-06	P002	3	250	Mumbai	Invalid Sales calculation
âœ¨ Key Insights

Data Quality Assurance â€“ Prevents bad data from reaching business dashboards.

Automation First â€“ Hands-free daily execution with clear segregation of valid/invalid data.

Error Transparency â€“ Provides detailed rejection logs for quick root cause analysis.

Scalable Framework â€“ Can be extended with new validations, DB integration, or email alerts.

ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

Integrate with a SQL database for storage and analytics.

Send email notifications to business users after processing.

Replace CSVs with API / message queue ingestion.

Add logging framework for better monitoring.
